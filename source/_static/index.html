/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.
*/

	padding: 10px 0; /* using padding instead of margin will allow you to keep the element away from the edges of the div */
}

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 {
	float: left; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}

	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.

	background:#DDDDDD;
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #footer p {

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>During this class we'll build a Minesweeper application. Along the way you'll learn about Python Programming and how much fun it can be. </p>
    <p>Hope you have fun!</p>
  <!-- end #sidebar1 --></div>
  <div id="mainContent">
    <h1> Creating a GUI Application</h1>
    <p>In this class we will create a Minesweeper application. Along the way you'll learn some things about computer programming. The word GUI stands for Graphical User Interface and refers to programs that run in a window. Of course, minesweeper is one of those applications. </p>
    <h2>Turtle Graphics</h2>
    <p>To write the minesweeper application you'll need to learn some things about Turtle Graphics. To use turtle graphics we create a turtle. The idea is a turtle runs around on the sand leaving a trail with its tail. The trail can paint a picture. Actually, a turtle can do a lot more than leave a trail. </p>
    <p>To create a turtle you write a Python program using an Integrated Development Environment like the Wing IDE. You can download Wing for free on your own computer. <a href="http://cs.luther.edu/~leekent/CS1">Directions to do that can be found here</a>. </p>
    <p>To create a turtle you start a new Python program and then write the following.</p>
    <pre>import turtle


myTurtle = turtle.Turtle()
</pre>
    <p>Then, the identifier myTurtle represents or refers to a turtle. You can send commands to this turtle my writing the name of it followed by a dot (i.e. a period) followed by the command. For instance, to tell the turtle to go forward 50 steps you would write:</p>
    <pre>myTurtle.forward(50)
</pre>
    <p>    There are other commands that you might want to send to a turtle. Try these commands out to see what they do.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>left(90)</li>
      <li>right(45)</li>
      <li>goto(100,300)</li>
      <li>ht()</li>
      <li>penup()</li>
      <li>pendown()</li>
      <li>shape(&quot;turtle&quot;)</li>
      <li>color(&quot;green&quot;)</li>
      <li>write(&quot;Hello World&quot;)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Starting the Application</h2>
    <p>To start the Minesweeper application you can copy this code and these pictures to a folder on you computer. The code and the pictures must all be in the same folder on your computer. </p>
    <p><img src="/~leekent/Dorian/Minesweeper/bomb36.gif" width="36" height="36" /><img src="/~leekent/Dorian/Minesweeper/flag36.gif" width="36" height="36" /><img src="/~leekent/Dorian/Minesweeper/tile36.gif" width="36" height="36" /></p>
    <p>The <a href="/~leekent/Dorian/Minesweeper/minesweeper.py">starter code can be found here</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>You might take a couple of minutes to look over this Python code. The Tile class inherits from the Turtle class. This means a Tile is the same things as a Turtle except with some extra things attached. </p>
    <p>The MineSweepApplication inherits from the Frame class. A MineSweepApplication is a Frame with some extra things attached. A Frame is a widget that is a container. It holds other widgets like Turtles or Tiles for instance. </p>
    <h2><a href="minesweeper.py">Day Two</a></h2>
    <p>If you run the starter code you might notice a very small window appear on the screen. Our goal today is to fill in that window with a canvas area where we can create turtles (i.e. Tiles), create a menu and get ready to write the code for starting a game. </p>
    <p>The code we write will go in the <strong>buildWindow</strong> method of the MineSweepApplication. </p>
    <p>To begin, let's give our application a name and create an area where we can draw with turtles. To do this we write this code.</p>
    <pre>canvas = tkinter.Canvas(self,width=600,height=600)
canvas.pack(side=tkinter.LEFT)
 
theTurtle = turtle.RawTurtle(canvas)
theTurtle.ht()


self.master.title(&quot;Minesweeper&quot;)
</pre>
    <p>This tells the master window (i.e. the root window) to change its title to <em>Minesweeper</em> and creates a canvas where turtles can draw. </p>
    <p>To create a menu for our application we create a Menu widget called <em>bar</em>, add a File menu widget to the menu bar and then add a couple of menu commands to the file menu as follows. </p>
    <pre>bar = tkinter.Menu(self.master)
fileMenu = tkinter.Menu(bar,tearoff=0)</pre>
    <pre>def newGame():
    print(&quot;New Game Selected&quot;)
     </pre>
    <pre>fileMenu.add_command(label=&quot;New Game&quot;,command=newGame)
         
fileMenu.add_command(label=&quot;Exit&quot;,command=self.master.quit)
   
bar.add_cascade(label=&quot;File&quot;,menu=fileMenu)
   
self.master.config(menu=bar)</pre>
    <pre>
newGame() </pre>
    <p>Now you can tell the turtle called theTurtle to do some of the commands that you learned above to see that it will draw on the canvas that you have created. </p>
    <p>Finally, we create sidebar area to keep track of the number of bombs that are left. Our game will have 40 bombs in a 16x16 grid of tiles. </p>
    <pre>sideBar = tkinter.Frame(self,padx=5,pady=5)
sideBar.pack(side=tkinter.RIGHT, fill=tkinter.BOTH)
 
bombLabel = tkinter.Label(sideBar,text=&quot;Bombs = 40&quot;)
bombLabel.pack()
 
self.tileLabel = tkinter.Label(sideBar,text=&quot;Tiles = 256&quot;)
self.tileLabel.pack() </pre>
    <p> When the program starts the <em>newGame</em> function is called. This function starts the game by creating the mines and tiles and then displaying them in a 16x16 grid. You write the following code in the newGame function definition.</p>
    <p>To keep track of a 16x16 grid in the program we construct a list of lists. Each list is a row of tiles in the minesweeper program. There are 16 of these rows. All 16 rows are put in another list called the matrix. The matrix is a variable in the MineSweepApplication. </p>
    <p>The screen is an object that we can use to change the coordinates of the canvas. We can also register shapes with it. When we register a shape we say that we want a turtle to take that shape somewhere in our program. </p>
    <p>We get the screen from the initial turtle we created. Then we can set the coordinates to be a 600x600 pixel canvas with (0,0) in the upper left corner. We can then clear the screen and set tracer to 0. The tracer command on the screen tells the screen not to update unless we tell it to update. This speeds up the program so that turtles appear to move very fast when we give them commands. Here is the code that does this. You can add this to the <em>newGame</em> function.</p>
    <pre>screen = theTurtle.getscreen()
screen.setworldcoordinates(0,600,600,0) 
screen.clear()
screen.tracer(0)
self.screen = screen
</pre>
    <p>We now want to register some shapes. This is necessary because we will have turtles use these shapes later in our program. Some turtles will look like bombs, others flags, and still others will look like tiles. Turtle graphics requires you to register these shapes before a turtle can change its shape.</p>
    <pre>screen.register_shape(&quot;bomb36.gif&quot;)
screen.register_shape(&quot;tile36.gif&quot;)
screen.register_shape(&quot;flag36.gif&quot;)</pre>
    <p>When new game is called there may be an old game that needs to be cleaned up. Since each tile is a Turtle, we can clean up the old game by moving the turtles off the screen. To do this we write a couple of <em>for</em> loops to go through all the rows of the matrix and for each row all the columns of the row. Here is what the code looks like:</p>
    <pre>for row in self.matrix:
    for tile in row:
        tile.goto(-1000,-1000)
    </pre>
    <p>No game is interesting unless there is some randomness to the game. In Minesweeper we want the 40 bombs to appear at random locations within the game. We'll create 40 random numbers to go along with the 40 random bombs that we'll create. The random.randrange(256) function will generate a random number between 0 and 255. Because it might generate a same random number twice (or more) there is a little bit of code to make sure that random numbers in this range don't repeat (so we get 40 random numbers). </p>
    <pre>randomNumbers = []
       
for i in range(40):
    r = random.randrange(256)
    while r in randomNumbers:
        r = random.randrange(256)
    randomNumbers.append(r)</pre>
    <p>Next, we create 256 tiles by creating the 16x16 matrix. As we create tiles we'll count from 0 to 255. If we come to a number that is in our list of random numbers, we'll make a tile a bomb. Otherwise, a tile is just a tile. Here is code to do this:</p>
    <pre>self.matrix = []
self.tileNum = 256
count = 0
 
for rowIndex in range(16):
    row = []
 
    for colIndex in range(16):
        bomb = (count in randomNumbers)</pre>
    <pre> 
        aTile = Tile(canvas,screen,rowIndex,colIndex,\
                    self.matrix,bomb,self)
        count = count + 1 
        row.append(aTile)
   
    self.matrix.append(row)


self.screen.update()</pre>
    <h2><a href="minesweeperday2.py">Day Three</a><br>
    </h2>
    <p>Up to this point, the application doesn't really do anything. The canvas appears, but no tiles or bombs. We need to complete the Tile class to get the program working. Right now the <em>__init__</em> method in the Tile class has one line in it: the call to <em>super().__init__(canvas)</em>. We should keep in mind that the Tile class inherits from the <em>RawTurtle</em> class (which is really just a <em>Turtle</em> itself). There is a lot of information passed to a Tile object when it is created. The <strong>canvas</strong> it will be diplayed on is passed. The <strong>screen</strong> object is useful and is passed in as well. The <strong>rowIndex</strong> is the row in the matrix (starting at 0) that the tile is in. The <strong>colIndex</strong> again goes from 0 to 15. The <strong>matrix</strong> is the entire matrix of Tiles. The <strong>bomb</strong> variable is <em>True</em> if this tile is a bomb and <em>False</em> otherwise. The <strong>gameApp</strong> variable points back at the game application object for use later. <br class="clearfloat" />
   </p>
    <p>We store all this information in the object. The <em>self</em> variable points at the current object so if we write <em>self.somevariable</em> we are referring to <em>somevariable</em> in the object pointed to by <em>self</em>. So to store gameApp in the object, we write</p>
    <pre>self.gameApp = gameApp</pre>
    <p>and we add this code to the __init__ method in the Tile class. Write similar code to store all the other variables in a tile object. </p>
    <p>Remember that self is a turtle in the Tile class because a Tile is a Turtle since the Tile classinherits from Turtle. We want to tell the tile to pick up its pen and to take on the shape of a tile. To change the turtle's shape we write this:</p>
    <pre>self.shape(&quot;tile36.gif&quot;)</pre>
    <p>Now we also want the Tile to go to the correct location on the screen for its row and column. Since the upper left corner is (0,0) and the width and height are 600 pixels, where should a Tile with rowIndex and colIndex be located? Figure this out and then tell <em>self</em> to go there using a <em>goto</em> command. </p>
    <p>In a GUI application we write event handlers. An event handler gets called when an event like a button press or mouse click happens in a program. We tell our program which event handler to call by <em>installing</em> the event handler. When we click the left mouse button, we want to run some code in our program. Here is how we install an event handler in our application.</p>
    <pre>def leftClickHandler(x,y):
    self.whenLeftClicked()
 
self.onclick(leftClickHandler)
</pre>
    <p>For this code to work, you must add another method to the Tile class. The <em>whenLeftClicked</em> method should be defined  in the Tile class with one parameter, self. You can have it print &quot;In whenLeftClicked&quot; for now. </p>
    <p>You must also install an event handler for the right-click button. This is done by installing the event handler as follows:</p>
    <pre>self.onclick(rightClickHandler,btn=3)
</pre>
    <p>Be sure to define <em>rightClickHandler</em> and <em>whenRightClicked</em> just as you did above for left clicks.</p>
    <p>That's it for today!</p>
    <h2><a href="minesweeperday3.py">Day Four</a></h2>
    <p>Today gets a bit more complicated. We'll start with the right-click handler called <em>whenRightClicked</em>. When we right-click on a tile we will change its shape to a flag. Look in the __init__ method of the Tile class to see how the shape of the turtle was changed to a tile. Then, change the shape to a flag36.gif. Don't forget to update the screen after you have done this. </p>
    <p>When the left button is clicked we want to either end the game and display all the bombs, or clear all the adjacent tiles that are not next to bombs and possibly display a number. We'll start by checking to see if the turtle/tile is visible or not. This code gets added into the <em>whenLeftClicked</em> method.</p>
    <p>If the tile is visible, then we want to know whether it is a bomb or not. If it is a bomb we'll change it's shape to bomb and then display all the other bombs and end the game. Here is some code to get us started. Again, this goes in the <em>whenLeftClicked</em> method.</p>
    <pre>if self.isvisible():
    if self.bomb:
        self.shape(&quot;bomb36.gif&quot;)
        self.screen.update()
        tkinter.messagebox.showinfo(\
            message=&quot;You blew up!! Game Over!!&quot;, \
            title=&quot;Game Over!!!&quot;)
        self.gameApp.gameOver()
</pre>
    <p>For this code to completely work you must define a new method in the MineSweepApplication class called <em>gameOver</em>. This method should go through each row in the matrix and for each tile in each row it should call a new method called <em>gameOver</em> on the tile. After doing this, don't forget to update the screen with this statement:</p>
    <pre>self.screen.update()</pre>
    <p> The tile's <em>gameOver</em> method should display itself as a bomb (if it is a bomb). You may also want to disable all mouse clicks. You can do this in the Tile gameOver method by writing this:</p>
    <pre> self.onclick(None)
 self.onclick(None,btn=3)
</pre>
    <p>That's enough for today. We'll finish up the application tomorrow!<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a href="minesweeperday4.py">Day Five</a></h2>
    <p>Today we finish the application by clearing non-bomb tiles from the screen and their non-bomb neighbors. To do this we add an else statement to the whenLeftClicked method as outlined below.</p>
    <pre>if self.isvisible():<br />    if self.bomb:<br />        # stuff we wrote yesterday<br />    else:
        # stuff we write today    
</pre>
    <p>To complete this code we want to do the following. First we want to hide the tile and decrement the number of tiles in the game. We can do this by writing a line of code like this:</p>
    <pre>self.ht()
self.gameApp.decTileNum()</pre>
    <p>But, for this to work we'll need to define a decTileNum method on our MinesweepApplication class as folllows.</p>
    <pre>def decTileNum(self):<br />    self.tileNum = self.tileNum - 1<br />    self.tileLabel.config(text=&quot;Tiles = &quot; + str(self.tileNum))<br />    if self.tileNum == 40:<br />        self.gameOver()<br />        tkinter.messagebox.showinfo(\
           message=&quot;You didn't blow up! Congratulations!!&quot;,\
           title=&quot;You Won!!!!&quot;)   </pre>
    <p>Now we need to make all the neighbor tiles of this tile disappear if they are not bombs. To do this we want to make a list of the neighbors that are not bombs and count them as well. This is a little complicated but picture counting all the neighbors of a tile and adding them to a list. Here is code that does this.</p>
    <pre>neighbors = []<br />bombNeighbors = 0<br />                <br />for i in range(self.rowIndex-1,self.rowIndex+2,1):<br />    for j in range(self.colIndex-1,self.colIndex+2,1):<br />        if i &gt;= 0 and i &lt; len(self.matrix) \
           and j &gt;= 0 and j &lt; len(self.matrix):<br />            if i != self.rowIndex or j != self.colIndex:<br />                neighbor = self.matrix[i][j]<br />                                <br />                if not neighbor.bomb:<br />                    neighbors.append(neighbor)<br />                else:<br />                    bombNeighbors = bombNeighbors+1</pre>
    <p>Then, once we have the list of neighbors, if none of the neighbors are bombs, we can uncover the neighbors by going through the list of neighbors and calling <em>whenLeftClicked</em> on them.</p>
    <p>The last little bit is to display a number in place of a tile to indicate the number of bombs that are adjacent to the tile. This code will do that.</p>
    <pre>if bombNeighbors &gt; 0:<br />    if bombNeighbors == 1:<br />        color = &quot;blue&quot;
    elif bombNeighbors == 2:<br />        color = &quot;green&quot;
    elif bombNeighbors == 3:
        color = &quot;red&quot;
    elif bombNeighbors == 4:
        color = &quot;purple&quot;
    else:
        color = &quot;black&quot;<br />                        
    self.color(color)<br />               
    self.left(90)
    self.forward(18)
    self.write(str(bombNeighbors),align=&quot;center&quot;,\
               font=(&quot;Arial&quot;,18,&quot;bold&quot;))
    self.right(90)
    self.forward(18)
   </pre>
    <p>That's it! You now have a complete Minesweeper application! Congratulations on learning some Python Programming!</p>
